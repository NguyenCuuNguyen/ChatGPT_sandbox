There is skepticism regarding the efficacy of these booster shots, especially based on titers of antibody in an underpowered trial.\n\nRepresentative tweet: "This is, of course, absurd.The idea the state should coerce parents to vaccinate kids who have _already had_ an infection w a recent strain of COVID using a version that _no longer circulates_ based on nothing more than titers of antibody in an underpowered trial is laughable."\n\nTopic 2: Urgent need to improve COVID-19 vaccination rates in children aged 5-11\nDescription: This topic highlights the urgency to improve COVID-19 vaccination rates in children aged 5-11 in Australia. The tweet emphasizes that only 40% of kids in this age group have received two doses and underlines the importance of protecting children during the current pandemic wave.\n\nRepresentative tweet: "Australia needs to urgently improve #COVID19Aus vaccination rates in 5-11 year olds. Only 40% of kids in this age have received 2 doses.
